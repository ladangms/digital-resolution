### What's your #DigitalResolution?

### [https://shannonvturner.com/resolutions](https://shannonvturner.com/resolutions)

Lightweight Django app that I built for the Digital Resolutions party in January 2015.

Send a text message -> see your digital resolution up on the screen.

Uses [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) to receive text messages and send them to the Django server for processing.

#### Want to try it out yourself?

Here's a [slideshow that will guide you through installing and running this on your computer](https://github.com/hearmecode/slides/blob/master/Workshop%20Web%20Dev/Hear%20Me%20Code%20-%20Intro%20Web%20Dev.pdf)

(This Django app was built in 2015 and uses Django 1.7; since then I have remixed it and have another version running on Django 1.11, which can be a little easier to set up and get running. See [https://github.com/shannonturner/digital-resolution-2](https://github.com/shannonturner/digital-resolution-2) for the code.)
